# Delegators Dashboard – The Graph Network
This project generates an interactive HTML dashboard to monitor live **delegation** and **undelegation** activity on [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com/).  
It highlights recent activity by delegators, indexed by timestamp, indexer, token amount, and event type.

> **v2.0.2** — Switched to custom `graph-delegation-events` subgraph: exact per-transaction GRT amounts, Tx hash column with Arbiscan links, withdrawal event type. Three rounds of 10 bug fixes each for reliability, data safety, and correctness.

**Live Dashboard:**  
🔗 [graphtools.pro/delegators](https://graphtools.pro/delegators/)

🧪 This dashboard is part of [**Graph Tools Pro**](https://graphtools.pro), a community-driven initiative to provide useful, independent analytics tools for The Graph ecosystem.

## 🧩 Custom Subgraph — `graph-delegation-events`

> **Status:** Deployed on The Graph Network. Source code in [`./subgraph/`](./subgraph/).  
> Full documentation → **[subgraph/README.md](./subgraph/README.md)**

**`graph-delegation-events`** is a purpose-built subgraph for indexing delegation-side staking activity from The Graph Network's staking contract on Arbitrum One. It is the primary data source for this dashboard since **v2.0.0**.

Its objective is to provide an **event-level record** of delegation and undelegation flows, capturing the **exact GRT delta** for each on-chain transaction rather than the latest aggregate stake state. Unlike state-based entities such as `delegatedStakes` — which only expose the current balance of a delegator-indexer position — this subgraph models the underlying staking events directly. That makes it possible to show precise GRT amounts for every delegation, top-up, undelegation, and withdrawal.

It supports both **legacy** (pre-Horizon) and **Horizon** (post-Dec 2025) event formats.

### What it indexes

| Era | Contract Event | `eventType` |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy | `StakeDelegated` | `delegation` |
| Legacy | `StakeDelegatedLocked` | `undelegation` |
| Legacy | `StakeDelegatedWithdrawn` | `withdrawal` |
| Horizon | `TokensDelegated` | `delegation` |
| Horizon | `TokensUndelegated` | `undelegation` |
| Horizon | `DelegatedTokensWithdrawn` | `withdrawal` |

### Contract

- **Network:** Arbitrum One
- **Address:** [`0x00669A4CF01450B64E8A2A20E9b1FCB71E61eF03`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00669A4CF01450B64E8A2A20E9b1FCB71E61eF03)
- **Start block:** `42,440,000`

For the full schema, example queries, and deploy instructions, see **[subgraph/README.md](./subgraph/README.md)**.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option A — One-command run (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdiomede/delegators-dashboard.git
cd delegators-dashboard
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your API keys
./run_delegators.sh
```

`run_delegators.sh` automatically creates the virtual environment, installs all dependencies, and runs the script.

### Option B — Manual setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdiomede/delegators-dashboard.git
cd delegators-dashboard
```

2. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
# API key for The Graph gateway (used for all subgraph queries)
# Get yours at: https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/
GRAPH_API_KEY=[api-key]

# Subgraph ID for the custom graph-delegation-events subgraph (required)
# Find it in Subgraph Studio or The Graph Explorer
GRAPH_DELEGATION_EVENTS=[subgraph-id]

# Optional: separate API key for ENS subgraph queries (falls back to GRAPH_API_KEY)
# ENS_API_KEY=[api-key]

# Records to fetch (gateway caps each page at 1000; pagination is automatic)
TRANSACTION_COUNT=1000

# Filter out delegations below this GRT amount
GRT_SIZE=10000

# ENS cache file path (relative to script dir); delete to force a full refresh
ENS_CACHE_FILE=ens_cache.json

# Hours before a cached ENS name is re-fetched (0 = always refresh; 168 = weekly)
ENS_CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS=48
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:
```bash
python3 fetch_delegators_metrics.py
```

5. Open `reports/index.html` in your browser.

## 🛡️ Notes

- `.env` and `.DS_Store` are excluded via `.gitignore`
- `GRAPH_DELEGATION_EVENTS` must be set in `.env` — the script raises a clear error on startup if missing or still set to the placeholder value
- Since v2.0.0, delegation data comes from the **custom `graph-delegation-events` subgraph** (see [`subgraph/README.md`](./subgraph/README.md)), which exposes exact per-transaction GRT amounts and transaction hashes
- ENS names are cached locally in `ens_cache.json` for performance (configurable TTL via `ENS_CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS`); a corrupt cache file is handled gracefully (auto-reset to empty)
- The Graph gateway caps `first` at **1000 per query**; the script automatically paginates using a timestamp cursor, always fetching the most recently active records first
- `run_delegators_vps.sh` is a VPS-specific variant that also copies the generated reports into the nginx web root (`/var/www/graphtools.pro/delegators/`)
- If `ENS_API_KEY` is not set in `.env`, it silently falls back to `GRAPH_API_KEY`

## 📋 Changelog

> Full history in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

### v2.0.2
- **10 reliability & observability fixes (round 3):** `encoding='utf-8'` added to log file, ENS cache read/write, and HTML/CSV writers; avatar cache no longer poisoned by transient network errors; `JSONDecodeError` now caught in both `fetch_ens_name` and `fetch_indexer_avatar`; `fetch_events()` logs start and loaded-count; `_paginate` progress log moved after deduplication (accurate unique count); `<table>` wrapped with semantic `<thead>` / `<tbody>`; `TRANSACTION_COUNT = 0` raises a clear startup error; warning logged when subgraph returns 0 events
- **10 data safety & correctness fixes (round 4):** `GRT_SIZE < 0` raises a clear startup error; `data.get("items") or []` replaces hard key access in `_paginate`; null `tokens` / `timestamp` fields from the subgraph now skip the event with a warning instead of crashing; unknown `eventType` values render as `❓` with a tooltip instead of being silently misclassified as withdrawals; JS GRT filter no longer hides 0-token withdrawal rows (consistent with Python server-side); `fetch_indexer_avatar` gains the same `None`/empty address guard as `fetch_ens_name`; `timestamp` ("Generated on") computed at HTML write time instead of module load; `<body>` class `"dark-mode"` removed (no matching CSS rule; dark mode comes from `:root` defaults)

### v2.0.1
- Fixed `block_datetime` in CSV export serialised as `str(datetime)` instead of ISO 8601 via `.isoformat()`
- Added `encoding='utf-8'` to both HTML and CSV file writers
- Fixed unescaped `&` in `<title>` and `<meta>` OG/Twitter tags — now correctly `&amp;`
- Fixed `GRT_SIZE * 10**18` recomputed on every table row — now uses pre-computed `grt_threshold`
- Removed `global` declarations in `fetch_events()` and `fetch_metrics()`
- Removed noisy ENS cache-hit log line (~2 000 lines per 1 000-event run)
- `fetch_ens_name`: stale cached name returned as fallback on network error
- `_paginate`: mid-pagination exceptions return partial results instead of crashing
- `generate_delegators_to_html`: added `✅ Saved HTML dashboard` success log
- `TRANSACTION_COUNT` / `GRT_SIZE` invalid values raise `EnvironmentError` with a clear message

### v2.0.0 ⭐ Major release
- **Switched data source** to custom `graph-delegation-events` subgraph (event-based, exact GRT deltas)
- **Exact GRT amounts** per transaction for all event types
- **New "Tx" column** — transaction hash as Arbiscan link
- **New "Withdrawal" event type** (`🔓 Withdrawal`)
- Stats panel and filter bar updated to reflect new event model
- Requires `GRAPH_DELEGATION_EVENTS` in `.env`

### v1.4.x — v1.0.8
See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full history.
