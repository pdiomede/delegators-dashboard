# Delegators Dashboard – The Graph Network
This project generates an interactive HTML dashboard to monitor live **delegation** and **undelegation** activity on [The Graph Network](https://thegraph.com/).  
It highlights recent activity by delegators, indexed by timestamp, indexer, token amount, and event type.

> **v1.2.1** — Social sharing card (og:image), VPS deploy fixes, footer version resolved, nginx permissions guide.

**Live Dashboard:**  
🔗 [graphtools.pro/delegators](https://graphtools.pro/delegators/)

🧪 This dashboard is part of [**Graph Tools Pro**](https://graphtools.pro), a community-driven initiative to provide useful, independent analytics tools for The Graph ecosystem.

## 🔗 Subgraphs Used

| Role | Subgraph | ID | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delegation events | Graph Analytics Arbitrum | `AgV4u2z1BFZKSj4Go1AdQswUGW2FcAtnPhifd4V7NLVz` | `GRAPH_API_KEY` |
| Indexer metadata/avatars | Graph Network Arbitrum | `DZz4kDTdmzWLWsV373w2bSmoar3umKKH9y82SUKr5qmp` | `GRAPH_API_KEY` |
| ENS names | ENS Subgraph | `5XqPmWe6gjyrJtFn9cLy237i4cWw2j9HcUJEXsP5qGtH` | `ENS_API_KEY` (full URL) |

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option A — One-command run (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdiomede/delegators-dashboard.git
cd delegators-dashboard
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your API keys
./run_delegators.sh
```

`run_delegators.sh` automatically creates the virtual environment, installs all dependencies, and runs the script.

### Option B — Manual setup

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pdiomede/delegators-dashboard.git
cd delegators-dashboard
```

2. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
# API key for The Graph gateway (used for delegation + avatar subgraphs)
# Get yours at: https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/
GRAPH_API_KEY=[api-key]

# Full ENS subgraph URL with its own dedicated API key embedded
ENS_API_KEY=https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/5XqPmWe6gjyrJtFn9cLy237i4cWw2j9HcUJEXsP5qGtH

# Records to fetch (gateway caps each page at 1000; pagination is automatic)
TRANSACTION_COUNT=5000

# Filter out delegations below this GRT amount
GRT_SIZE=10000

# ENS cache file path (relative to script dir); delete to force a full refresh
ENS_CACHE_FILE=ens_cache.json

# Hours before a cached ENS name is re-fetched (0 = always refresh; 168 = weekly)
ENS_CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS=48
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script:
```bash
python3 fetch_delegators_metrics.py
```

5. Open `reports/index.html` in your browser.

## 🛡️ Notes

- `.env` and `.DS_Store` are excluded via `.gitignore`
- ENS names are cached locally in `ens_cache.json` for performance (configurable TTL via `ENS_CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS`). Delete the file to force a full refresh.
- The dashboard uses the **Graph Analytics Arbitrum** subgraph for delegation data — individual transaction hashes are not available in this subgraph (Tx column removed)
- ENS names are cached in memory during a run and persisted to `ens_cache.json`; a corrupt cache file is handled gracefully (auto-reset to empty)
- The Graph gateway caps `first` at **1000 per query**; the script automatically paginates using a timestamp cursor, always fetching the most recently active records first
- `run_delegators_vps.sh` is a VPS-specific variant that also copies the generated reports into the nginx web root (`/var/www/graphtools.pro/delegators/`)
- If `ENS_API_KEY` is missing from `.env`, ENS lookups are silently skipped (addresses shown as-is) rather than crashing

## 📋 Changelog

### v1.2.1
- Added `social-card.jpeg` (1200×630) for rich social sharing previews on X, LinkedIn, etc.
- Updated `og:image` and `twitter:image` meta tags to point to the new card
- Fixed footer version not rendering (`{DASHBOARD_VERSION}` was inside a non-f-string)
- Fixed `run_delegators_vps.sh`: `social-card.jpeg` now only copied on first deploy (skipped if already present)
- Fixed `run_delegators_vps.sh`: `chown paolo:www-data` applied consistently to all deployed files

### v1.2.0
- Removed Tx column (transaction hashes unavailable from the Analytics subgraph)
- Refactored footer: `©Year Graph Tools Pro  |  Delegators Dashboard vX.X.X  |  Author: Paolo Diomede  |  View on GitHub`; version pulled dynamically from `DASHBOARD_VERSION`
- Fixed `tokens: float` → `int` in `DelegationEvent` (float loses precision on large wei values)
- Fixed favicon MIME type: `image/png` → `image/x-icon` for `.ico` file
- Fixed filter link `href="#"` causing page-top scroll on click → `javascript:void(0)`
- Fixed `run_query` not guarding against `payload["data"]` being `None`
- Replaced per-call cache file I/O in `fetch_ens_name` with a module-level in-memory dict (loaded once, saved on update)
- Protected ENS cache JSON load against corrupt/empty file (`JSONDecodeError` → graceful reset)
- Narrowed `fetch_indexer_avatar` exception catch from bare `Exception` to `requests.RequestException`
- Removed unnecessary `global` declarations in `generate_delegators_to_csv` and `generate_delegators_to_html`
- Fixed `window.scrollTo` firing on initial page load (added `_initialLoad` flag)
- Fixed `_paginate` timestamp boundary — switched from `_lt` to composite `_lte + id_lt` cursor to avoid skipping records that share a boundary timestamp
- Bumped version to 1.2.0

### v1.1.0
- Added table pagination: 50 rows per page with first/prev/page-numbers/next/last controls
- Pagination is fully integrated with event type filter, GRT filter, and search box
- Fixed data freshness: records now fetched ordered by `lastDelegatedAt`/`lastUndelegatedAt` DESC so the most recent activity always appears first (previously oldest records were shown)
- Updated footer: author credit for Paolo Diomede with link, GitHub repo link with icon
- Bumped version to 1.1.0

### v1.0.9
- Fixed `log_message` being called before `log_file` was defined (latent `NameError`)
- Fixed typo `TRANSCATION_COUNT` → `TRANSACTION_COUNT` in `fetch_metrics()`
- Fixed missing `<tr>` opening tag in HTML table header (malformed HTML)
- Fixed `ENS_SUBGRAPH_URL` being `None` when `ENS_API_KEY` is missing — now skips gracefully
- Fixed `generate_delegators_to_csv` crashing with `IndexError` on empty event list
- Fixed JS filter: `"Delegation"` was incorrectly matching rows labelled `"Undelegation"`
- Removed dead code: `fetch_ens_name2` (duplicate of `fetch_ens_name`, never called)
- Fixed ENS cache timestamp comparison using `.astimezone()` instead of `.replace(tzinfo=)`
- Added empty-event guard in `generate_delegators_to_html`
- Removed unused `order_by` parameter from `_paginate()`

### v1.0.8
- Migrated to Arbitrum subgraphs (Graph Analytics + Graph Network)
- Added `id_gt` cursor pagination — `TRANSACTION_COUNT` can safely exceed 1000
- Added explicit `RuntimeError` when subgraph returns errors instead of data
- Added `EnvironmentError` guard if `GRAPH_API_KEY` is missing
- Added `run_delegators_vps.sh` for VPS deployment to nginx
- ENS lookup now uses dedicated `ENS_API_KEY` URL from `.env`
- Thousands separator on transaction count in dashboard header
